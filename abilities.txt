Akshan may input a movement command to use the second and third casts. <br/>  <br/> FIRST CAST: Akshan fires a hook in the target direction, which grapples to the first instance of terrain hit for 1.5 seconds. Heroic Swing's second cast can be used while the hook is attached. If Akshan becomes immobilized or grounded during this time, the hook will detach, ending Heroic Swing prematurely. <br/>  <br/> SECOND CAST: Akshan swings around the terrain, rapidly firing at the nearest visible enemy to deal them 30 / 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 (+0.175% bonus attack damage) × (1 + 0.3% bonus attack speed) physical damage and apply on-hit and on-attack effects at 25% effectiveness per shot, and stopping upon colliding with an enemy champion or terrain, or after 3 seconds. <br/>  <br/> Akshan will be knocked down by any immobilizing crowd control during the dash. <br/>  <br/> THIRD CAST: Akshan jumps off of the rope to the target location and fires one last shot at a nearby visible enemy. <br/>  <br/> Heroic Swing's cooldown resets upon scoring a takedown against an enemy champion. The shots benefit from critical strike modifiers and apply life steal at 100% effectiveness. Akshan prioritizes firing at enemy champions with stacks of Dirty Fighting, will not fire if he is channeling Comeuppance, and reveals himself during Heroic Swing. ";"Akshan 31 ability"

"What does Ivern's Passive (Friend of the Forest) do?";"<img src=""Ivern-Passive-Friend-of-the-Forest.png""><br> Ivern cannot attack or damage non-epic monsters. Instead, targeting a jungle camp initiates a 2.5-second channel that, upon completion, places the monsters within a grove. Placing a grove costs 131.63 − 121 (based on level) health and 148.5 − 110.25 (based on level) mana, and cannot be cast if Ivern lacks the resources. <br/>  <br/> The grove matures over 40-30s (at levels 1-6), 27-15s (at levels 7-11), 11-3s (at levels 12-14), 1s (level 15+). When fully matured, Ivern can interact with the camp again to instantly free the monsters, sending them away while receiving their full gold and experience bounty. Smiting a camp within a grove will instantly free the monsters, regardless of its maturity or the monster's current health. <br/>  <br/> If the camp's large monster has already been slain, Ivern will free the camp upon completing the channel at no cost. Similarly, the grove will instantly mature if the large monster is slain. <br/>  <br/> Starting at level 5, freeing the Red Brambleback or Blue Sentinel leaves behind a sapling that can be picked up by an allied champion to gain the camp's buff, consuming it in the process. If at least one allied champion is nearby, Ivern can pick up the sapling to transfer it to the nearest one in range. If an ally kills either monster, they also leave behind a sapling that only Ivern can consume. ";"Ivern 145 ability"
